# My Store

This project is a simple ecommerce app I created to better understand the lessons I learned in regards to Angular.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## More About the App

The first view will allow you to pick a product from a catalogue, see more details about it, or add to cart and checkout.

If at any point you want to go back click the My Store title or an appropriately designed button

P.S. The app is programmed to allow users to add products multiple times without any worry that the entries will be duplicated
